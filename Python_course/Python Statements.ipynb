Take note of how the if, elif, and else line up in the code. This can help you see what if is related to what elif or else statements.\n\nWe'll reintroduce a comparison syntax for Python.\n\nIn [3]:\nloc = 'Bank'\n\nif loc == 'Auto Shop':\n    print('Welcome to the Auto Shop!')\nelif loc == 'Bank':\n    print('Welcome to the bank!')\nelse:\n    print('Where are you?')\nWelcome to the bank!\n\nModulo\nThe modulo allows us to get the remainder in a division and uses the % symbol. For example:\n\nIn [3]:\n17 % 5\nOut[3]:\n2\n\nExample 2\nLet's print only the even numbers from that list!\n\nIn [7]:\nfor num in list1:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        print(num)\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n\nExample 4\nWe've used for loops with lists, how about with strings? Remember strings are a sequence so when we iterate through them we will be accessing each item in that string.\n\nIn [11]:\nfor letter in 'This is a string.':\n    print(letter)\nT\nh\ni\ns\n \ni\ns\n \na\n\nExample 7\nIn [16]:\nd = {'k1':1,'k2':2,'k3':3}\nIn [17]:\nfor item in d:\n    print(item)\nk1\nk2\nk3\n\nfor k,v in d.items():\n    print(k)\n    print(v)\nk1\n1\nk2\n2\nk3\n3\n\nIf you want to obtain a true list of keys, values, or key/value tuples, you can cast the view as a list:\n\nIn [20]:\nlist(d.keys())\nOut[20]:\n['k1', 'k2', 'k3']\nRemember that dictionaries are unordered, and that keys and values come back in arbitrary order. You can obtain a sorted list using sorted():\n\nIn [21]:\nsorted(d.values())\nOut[21]:\n[1, 2, 3]\n\nA word of caution however! It is possible to create an infinitely running loop with while statements. For example:\n\nIn [ ]:\n# DO NOT RUN THIS CODE!!!! \nwhile True:\n    print(\"I'm stuck in an infinite loop!\")\n    \nrange\nThe range function allows you to quickly generate a list of integers, this comes in handy a lot, so take note of how to use it! There are 3 parameters you can pass, a start, a stop, and a step size. Let's see some examples:\n\nIn [1]:\nrange(0,11)\nOut[1]:\nrange(0, 11)\nNote that this is a generator function, so to actually get a list out of it, we need to cast it to a list with list(). What is a generator? Its a special type of function that will generate information and not need to save it to memory. We haven't talked about functions or generators yet, so just keep this in your notes for now, we will discuss this in much more detail in later on in your training!\n\nIn [3]:\n# Notice how 11 is not included, up to but not including 11, just like slice notation!\nlist(range(0,11))\nOut[3]:\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n\n\nIn [6]:\n# Third parameter is step size!\n# step size just means how big of a jump/leap/step you \n# take from the starting number to get to the next number.\n\nlist(range(0,11,2))\nOut[6]:\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\n\nenumerate\nenumerate is a very useful function to use with for loops. Let's imagine the following situation:\n\nIn [8]:\nindex_count = 0\n\nfor letter in 'abcde':\n    print(\"At index {} the letter is {}\".format(index_count,letter))\n    index_count += 1\nAt index 0 the letter is a\nAt index 1 the letter is b\nAt index 2 the letter is c\nAt index 3 the letter is d\nAt index 4 the letter is e\nKeeping track of how many loops you've gone through is so common, that enumerate was created so you don't need to worry about creating and updating this index_count or loop_count variable\n\nIn [10]:\n# Notice the tuple unpacking!\n\nfor i,letter in enumerate('abcde'):\n    print(\"At index {} the letter is {}\".format(i,letter))\nAt index 0 the letter is a\nAt index 1 the letter is b\nAt index 2 the letter is c\nAt index 3 the letter is d\nAt index 4 the letter is e\n\n\nzip\nNotice the format enumerate actually returns, let's take a look by transforming it to a list()\n\nIn [12]:\nlist(enumerate('abcde'))\nOut[12]:\n[(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'd'), (4, 'e')]\nIt was a list of tuples, meaning we could use tuple unpacking during our for loop. This data structure is actually very common in Python , especially when working with outside libraries. You can use the zip() function to quickly create a list of tuples by \"zipping\" up together two lists.\n\nIn [13]:\nmylist1 = [1,2,3,4,5]\nmylist2 = ['a','b','c','d','e']\nIn [15]:\n# This one is also a generator! We will explain this later, but for now let's transform it to a list\nzip(mylist1,mylist2)\nOut[15]:\n<zip at 0x1d205086f08>\nIn [17]:\nlist(zip(mylist1,mylist2))\nOut[17]:\n[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd'), (5, 'e')]\n\n\n\nTo use the generator, we could just use a for loop\n\nIn [20]:\nfor item1, item2 in zip(mylist1,mylist2):\n    print('For this tuple, first item was {} and second item was {}'.format(item1,item2))\nFor this tuple, first item was 1 and second item was a\nFor this tuple, first item was 2 and second item was b\nFor this tuple, first item was 3 and second item was c\nFor this tuple, first item was 4 and second item was d\nFor this tuple, first item was 5 and second item was e\n\n\nn operator\nWe've already seen the in keyword during the for loop, but we can also use it to quickly check if an object is in a list\n\nIn [21]:\n'x' in ['x','y','z']\nOut[21]:\nTrue\nIn [22]:\n'x' in [1,2,3]\nOut[22]:\nFalse\nnot in\nWe can combine in with a not operator, to check if some object or variable is not present in a list.\n\nIn [1]:\n'x' not in ['x','y','z']\nOut[1]:\nFalse\nIn [2]:\n'x' not in [1,2,3]\nOut[2]:\nTrue\n\ninput\nIn [43]:\ninput('Enter Something into this box: ')\nEnter Something into this box: great job!\nOut[43]:\n'great job!'\n\n\nList Comprehensions\nIn addition to sequence operations and list methods, Python includes a more advanced operation called a list comprehension.\n\nList comprehensions allow us to build out lists using a different notation. You can think of it as essentially a one line for loop built inside of brackets. For a simple example:\n\nExample 1\nIn [1]:\n# Grab every letter in string\nlst = [x for x in 'word']\nIn [2]:\n# Check\nlst\nOut[2]:\n['w', 'o', 'r', 'd']\n\nExample 2\nIn [3]:\n# Square numbers in range and turn into list\nlst = [x**2 for x in range(0,11)]\nIn [4]:\nlst\nOut[4]:\n[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\nExample 3\nLet's see how to add in if statements:\n\nIn [5]:\n# Check for even numbers in a range\nlst = [x for x in range(11) if x % 2 == 0]\nIn [6]:\nlst\nOut[6]:\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\nExample 5\nWe can also perform nested list comprehensions, for example:\n\nIn [8]:\nlst = [ x**2 for x in [x**2 for x in range(11)]]\nlst\nOut[8]:\n[0, 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, 6561, 10000]\n\n\nUse for, .split(), and if to create a Statement that will print out words that start with 's':\n\nIn [1]:\nst = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'\nIn [2]:\nfor word in st.split():\n    if word[0] == 's':\n        print(word)\nstart\ns\nsentence\n\n\nWrite a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print \"Fizz\" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print \"Buzz\". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \"FizzBuzz\".\n\nIn [ ]:\nfor num in range(1,101):\n    if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:\n        print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n    elif num % 3 == 0:\n        print(\"Fizz\")\n    elif num % 5 == 0:\n        print(\"Buzz\")\n    else:\n        print(num)\n        \n        \nUse a List Comprehension to create a list of the first letters of every word in the string below:\n\nIn [7]:\nst = 'Create a list of the first letters of every word in this string'\nIn [8]:\n[word[0] for word in st.split()]\nOut[8]:\n['C', 'a', 'l', 'o', 't', 'f', 'l', 'o', 'e', 'w', 'i', 't', 's']\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  File \u001b[0;32m\"<ipython-input-2-f52f2c5cb583>\"\u001b[0;36m, line \u001b[0;32m1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    Multiple Branches\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m                    ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid syntax\n"],"ename":"SyntaxError","evalue":"invalid syntax (<ipython-input-2-f52f2c5cb583>, line 1)","output_type":"error"}]}]}

You can use combinations of double and single quotes to get the complete statement.\n\nIn [5]:\n\"Now I'm ready to use the single quotes inside a string!\"\nOut[5]:\n\"Now I'm ready to use the single quotes inside a string!\"\n\nWe can use a print statement to print a string.\n\nIn [8]:\nprint('Hello World 1')\nprint('Hello World 2')\nprint('Use \\n to print a new line')\nprint('\\n')\nprint('See what I mean?')\nHello World 1\nHello World 2\nUse \n to print a new line\n    \n\nString Basics\nWe can also use a function called len() to check the length of a string!\n\nIn [9]:\nlen('Hello World')\nOut[9]:\n11\n\nIn Python, we use brackets [] after an object to call its index. We should also note that indexing starts at 0 for Python. Let's create a new object called s and then walk through a few examples of indexing.\n\nIn [10]:\n# Assign s as a string\ns = 'Hello World'\nIn [11]:\n#Check\ns\nOut[11]:\n'Hello World'\nIn [12]:\n# Print the object\nprint(s)\nHello World\n\nIn [19]:\n#Everything\ns[:]\nOut[19]:\n'Hello World'\nWe can also use negative indexing to go backwards.\n\nIn [20]:\n# Last letter (one index behind 0 so it loops back around)\ns[-1]\nOut[20]:\n'd'\nIn [21]:\n# Grab everything but the last letter\ns[:-1]\nOut[21]:\n'Hello Worl'\nWe can also use index and slice notation to grab elements of a sequence by a specified step size (the default is 1). For instance we can use two colons in a row and then a number specifying the frequency to grab elements. For example:\n\nIn [22]:\n# Grab everything, but go in steps size of 1\ns[::1]\nOut[22]:\n'Hello World'\nIn [23]:\n# Grab everything, but go in step sizes of 2\ns[::2]\nOut[23]:\n'HloWrd'\nIn [24]:\n# We can use this to print a string backwards\ns[::-1]\nOut[24]:\n'dlroW olleH'\n\nString Properties\nIt's important to note that strings have an important property known as immutability. This means that once a string is created, the elements within it can not be changed or replaced. For example:\n\nIn [25]:\ns\nOut[25]:\n'Hello World'\nIn [26]:\n# Let's try to change the first letter to 'x'\ns[0] = 'x'\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-26-976942677f11> in <module>()\n      1 # Let's try to change the first letter to 'x'\n----> 2 s[0] = 'x'\n\nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\nNotice how the error tells us directly what we can't do, change the item assignment!\n\nSomething we can do is concatenate strings!\n\nIn [29]:\n# We can reassign s completely though!\ns = s + ' concatenate me!'\nIn [30]:\nprint(s)\nHello World concatenate me!\n\nWe can use the multiplication symbol to create repetition!\n\nIn [32]:\nletter = 'z'\nIn [33]:\nletter*10\nOut[33]:\n'zzzzzzzzzz'\n\nIn [34]:\ns\nOut[34]:\n'Hello World concatenate me!'\n\nIn [37]:\n# Split a string by blank space (this is the default)\ns.split()\nOut[37]:\n['Hello', 'World', 'concatenate', 'me!']\nIn [38]:\n# Split by a specific element (doesn't include the element that was split on)\ns.split('W')\nOut[38]:\n['Hello ', 'orld concatenate me!']\n\nPrint Formatting\nWe can use the .format() method to add formatted objects to printed string statements.\n\nThe easiest way to show this is through an example:\n\nIn [39]:\n'Insert another string with curly brackets: {}'.format('The inserted string')\nOut[39]:\n'Insert another string with curly brackets: The inserted string'\n\nFormatting with placeholders\nYou can use %s to inject strings into your print statements. The modulo % is referred to as a \"string formatting operator\".\n\nIn [1]:\nprint(\"I'm going to inject %s here.\" %'something')\nI'm going to inject something here.\nYou can pass multiple items by placing them inside a tuple after the % operator.\n\nIn [2]:\nprint(\"I'm going to inject %s text here, and %s text here.\" %('some','more'))\nI'm going to inject some text here, and more text here.\nYou can also pass variable names:\n\nIn [3]:\nx, y = 'some', 'more'\nprint(\"I'm going to inject %s text here, and %s text here.\"%(x,y))\nI'm going to inject some text here, and more text here.\n\nFormat conversion methods.\nIt should be noted that two methods %s and %r convert any python object to a string using two separate methods: str() and repr(). We will learn more about these functions later on in the course, but you should note that %r and repr() deliver the string representation of the object, including quotation marks and any escape characters.\n\nIn [4]:\nprint('He said his name was %s.' %'Fred')\nprint('He said his name was %r.' %'Fred')\nHe said his name was Fred.\nHe said his name was 'Fred'.\nAs another example, \\t inserts a tab into a string.\n\nIn [5]:\nprint('I once caught a fish %s.' %'this \\tbig')\nprint('I once caught a fish %r.' %'this \\tbig')\nI once caught a fish this \tbig.\nI once caught a fish 'this \\tbig'.\nThe %s operator converts whatever it sees into a string, including integers and floats. The %d operator converts numbers to integers first, without rounding. Note the difference below:\n\nIn [6]:\nprint('I wrote %s programs today.' %3.75)\nprint('I wrote %d programs today.' %3.75)\nI wrote 3.75 programs today.\nI wrote 3 programs today.\n\nPadding and Precision of Floating Point Numbers\nFloating point numbers use the format %5.2f. Here, 5 would be the minimum number of characters the string should contain; these may be padded with whitespace if the entire number does not have this many digits. Next to this, .2f stands for how many numbers to show past the decimal point. Let's see some examples:\n\nIn [7]:\nprint('Floating point numbers: %5.2f' %(13.144))\nFloating point numbers: 13.14\nIn [8]:\nprint('Floating point numbers: %1.0f' %(13.144))\nFloating point numbers: 13\nIn [9]:\nprint('Floating point numbers: %1.5f' %(13.144))\nFloating point numbers: 13.14400\n    \n\n    Multiple Formatting\nNothing prohibits using more than one conversion tool in the same print statement:\n\nIn [12]:\nprint('First: %s, Second: %5.2f, Third: %r' %('hi!',3.1415,'bye!'))\nFirst: hi!, Second:  3.14, Third: 'bye!'\n            \nFormatting with the .format() method\nA better way to format objects into your strings for print statements is with the string .format() method. The syntax is:\n\n'String here {} then also {}'.format('something1','something2')\n\nFor example:\n\nIn [13]:\nprint('This is a string with an {}'.format('insert'))\nThis is a string with an insert\nThe .format() method has several advantages over the %s placeholder method:\n1. Inserted objects can be called by index position:\nIn [14]:\nprint('The {2} {1} {0}'.format('fox','brown','quick'))\nThe quick brown fox\n2. Inserted objects can be assigned keywords:\nIn [15]:\nprint('First Object: {a}, Second Object: {b}, Third Object: {c}'.format(a=1,b='Two',c=12.3))\nFirst Object: 1, Second Object: Two, Third Object: 12.3\n3. Inserted objects can be reused, avoiding duplication:\nIn [16]:\nprint('A %s saved is a %s earned.' %('penny','penny'))\n# vs.\nprint('A {p} saved is a {p} earned.'.format(p='penny'))\nA penny saved is a penny earned.\nA penny saved is a penny earned.\n\nAlignment, padding and precision with .format()\nWithin the curly braces you can assign field lengths, left/right alignments, rounding parameters and more\n\nIn [17]:\nprint('{0:8} | {1:9}'.format('Fruit', 'Quantity'))\nprint('{0:8} | {1:9}'.format('Apples', 3.))\nprint('{0:8} | {1:9}'.format('Oranges', 10))\nFruit    | Quantity \nApples   |       3.0\nOranges  |        10\nBy default, .format() aligns text to the left, numbers to the right. You can pass an optional <,^, or > to set a left, center or right alignment:\n\nIn [18]:\nprint('{0:<8} | {1:^8} | {2:>8}'.format('Left','Center','Right'))\nprint('{0:<8} | {1:^8} | {2:>8}'.format(11,22,33))\nLeft     |  Center  |    Right\n11       |    22    |       33\nYou can precede the aligment operator with a padding character\n\nIn [19]:\nprint('{0:=<8} | {1:-^8} | {2:.>8}'.format('Left','Center','Right'))\nprint('{0:=<8} | {1:-^8} | {2:.>8}'.format(11,22,33))\nLeft==== | -Center- | ...Right\n11====== | ---22--- | ......33\n\nFormatted String Literals (f-strings)\nIntroduced in Python 3.6, f-strings offer several benefits over the older .format() string method described above. For one, you can bring outside variables immediately into to the string rather than pass them as arguments through .format(var).\n\nIn [21]:\nname = 'Fred'\n\nprint(f\"He said his name is {name}.\")\nHe said his name is Fred.\nPass !r to get the string representation:\n\nIn [22]:\nprint(f\"He said his name is {name!r}\")\nHe said his name is 'Fred'\n\nFloat formatting follows \"result: {value:{width}.{precision}}\"\nWhere with the .format() method you might see {value:10.4f}, with f-strings this can become {value:{10}.{6}}\n\nIn [23]:\nnum = 23.45678\nprint(\"My 10 character, four decimal number is:{0:10.4f}\".format(num))\nprint(f\"My 10 character, four decimal number is:{num:{10}.{6}}\")\nMy 10 character, four decimal number is:   23.4568\nMy 10 character, four decimal number is:   23.4568\n    \nIndexing and Slicing\nIndexing and slicing work just like in strings. Let's make a new list to remind ourselves of how this works:\n\nIn [4]:\nmy_list = ['one','two','three',4,5]\nIn [5]:\n# Grab element at index 0\nmy_list[0]\nOut[5]:\n'one'\nIn [6]:\n# Grab index 1 and everything past it\nmy_list[1:]\nOut[6]:\n['two', 'three', 4, 5]\nIn [7]:\n# Grab everything UP TO index 3\nmy_list[:3]\nOut[7]:\n['one', 'two', 'three']\n\nWe can also use the * for a duplication method similar to strings:\n\nIn [12]:\n# Make the list double\nmy_list * 2\nOut[12]:\n['one',\n 'two',\n 'three',\n 4,\n 5,\n 'add new item permanently',\n 'one',\n 'two',\n 'three',\n 4,\n 5,\n 'add new item permanently']\n\nUse the append method to permanently add an item to the end of a list:\n\nIn [15]:\n# Append\nlist1.append('append me!')\nIn [16]:\n# Show\nlist1\nOut[16]:\n[1, 2, 3, 'append me!']\n\n\nUse pop to \"pop off\" an item from the list. By default pop takes off the last index, but you can also specify which index to pop off. Let's see an example:\n\nIn [17]:\n# Pop off the 0 indexed item\nlist1.pop(0)\nOut[17]:\n1\nIn [18]:\n# Show\nlist1\nOut[18]:\n[2, 3, 'append me!']\n\nIn [19]:\n# Assign the popped element, remember default popped index is -1\npopped_item = list1.pop()\nIn [20]:\npopped_item\nOut[20]:\n'append me!'\nIn [21]:\n# Show remaining list\nlist1\nOut[21]:\n[2, 3]\n\nt should also be noted that lists indexing will return an error if there is no element at that index. For example:\n\nIn [22]:\nlist1[100]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-22-af6d2015fa1f> in <module>()\n----> 1 list1[100]\n\nIn [24]:\n#Show\nnew_list\nOut[24]:\n['a', 'e', 'x', 'b', 'c']\nIn [25]:\n# Use reverse to reverse order (this is permanent!)\nnew_list.reverse()\nIn [26]:\nnew_list\nOut[26]:\n['c', 'b', 'x', 'e', 'a']\nIn [27]:\n# Use sort to sort the list (in this case alphabetical order, but for numbers it will go ascending)\nnew_list.sort()\nIn [28]:\nnew_list\nOut[28]:\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'e', 'x']\n\nNesting Lists\nA great feature of of Python data structures is that they support nesting. This means we can have data structures within data structures. For example: A list inside a list.\n\nLet's see how this works!\n\nIn [29]:\n# Let's make three lists\nlst_1=[1,2,3]\nlst_2=[4,5,6]\nlst_3=[7,8,9]\n\n# Make a list of lists to form a matrix\nmatrix = [lst_1,lst_2,lst_3]\nIn [30]:\n# Show\nmatrix\nOut[30]:\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nWe can again use indexing to grab elements, but now there are two levels for the index. The items in the matrix object, and then the items inside that list!\n\nIn [31]:\n# Grab first item in matrix object\nmatrix[0]\nOut[31]:\n[1, 2, 3]\nIn [32]:\n# Grab first item of the first item in the matrix object\nmatrix[0][0]\nOut[32]:\n1\n\nList Comprehensions\nPython has an advanced feature called list comprehensions. They allow for quick construction of lists. To fully understand list comprehensions we need to understand for loops. So don't worry if you don't completely understand this section, and feel free to just skip it since we will return to this topic later.\n\nBut in case you want to know now, here are a few examples!\n\nIn [33]:\n# Build a list comprehension by deconstructing a for loop within a []\nfirst_col = [row[0] for row in matrix]\nIn [34]:\nfirst_col\nOut[34]:\n[1, 4, 7]\n\nIts important to note that dictionaries are very flexible in the data types they can hold. For example:\n\nIn [3]:\nmy_dict = {'key1':123,'key2':[12,23,33],'key3':['item0','item1','item2']}\nIn [4]:\n# Let's call items from the dictionary\nmy_dict['key3']\nOut[4]:\n['item0', 'item1', 'item2']\nIn [5]:\n# Can call an index on that value\nmy_dict['key3'][0]\nOut[5]:\n'item0'\nIn [6]:\n# Can then even call methods on that value\nmy_dict['key3'][0].upper()\nOut[6]:\n'ITEM0'\n\n\nWe can also create keys by assignment. For instance if we started off with an empty dictionary, we could continually add to it:\n\nIn [11]:\n# Create a new dictionary\nd = {}\nIn [12]:\n# Create a new key through assignment\nd['animal'] = 'Dog'\nIn [13]:\n# Can do this with any object\nd['answer'] = 42\nIn [14]:\n#Show\nd\nOut[14]:\n{'animal': 'Dog', 'answer': 42}\n\nNesting with Dictionaries\nHopefully you're starting to see how powerful Python is with its flexibility of nesting objects and calling methods on them. Let's see a dictionary nested inside a dictionary:\n\nIn [15]:\n# Dictionary nested inside a dictionary nested inside a dictionary\nd = {'key1':{'nestkey':{'subnestkey':'value'}}}\nWow! That's a quite the inception of dictionaries! Let's see how we can grab that value:\n\nIn [16]:\n# Keep calling the keys\nd['key1']['nestkey']['subnestkey']\nOut[16]:\n'value'\n\nA few Dictionary Methods\nThere are a few methods we can call on a dictionary. Let's get a quick introduction to a few of them:\n\nIn [17]:\n# Create a typical dictionary\nd = {'key1':1,'key2':2,'key3':3}\nIn [18]:\n# Method to return a list of all keys \nd.keys()\nOut[18]:\ndict_keys(['key1', 'key2', 'key3'])\nIn [19]:\n# Method to grab all values\nd.values()\nOut[19]:\ndict_values([1, 2, 3])\nIn [20]:\n# Method to return tuples of all items  (we'll learn about tuples soon)\nd.items()\nOut[20]:\ndict_items([('key1', 1), ('key2', 2), ('key3', 3)])\n\nTuples\nIn Python tuples are very similar to lists, however, unlike lists they are immutable meaning they can not be changed. You would use tuples to present things that shouldn't be changed, such as days of the week, or dates on a calendar.\n\nConstructing Tuples\nThe construction of a tuples use () with elements separated by commas. For example:\n\nIn [1]:\n# Create a tuple\nt = (1,2,3)\n\nBasic Tuple Methods\nTuples have built-in methods, but not as many as lists do. Let's look at two of them:\n\nIn [6]:\n# Use .index to enter a value and return the index\nt.index('one')\nOut[6]:\n0\nIn [7]:\n# Use .count to count the number of times a value appears\nt.count('one')\nOut[7]:\n1\n\nImmutability\nIt can't be stressed enough that tuples are immutable. To drive that point home:\n\nIn [8]:\nt[0]= 'change'\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-8-1257c0aa9edd> in <module>()\n----> 1 t[0]= 'change'\n\nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n    \n    \n    Because of this immutability, tuples can't grow. Once a tuple is made we can not add to it.\n\nIn [9]:\nt.append('nope')\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-9-b75f5b09ac19> in <module>()\n----> 1 t.append('nope')\n\nAttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'\n\nWhen to use Tuples\nYou may be wondering, \"Why bother using tuples when they have fewer available methods?\" To be honest, tuples are not used as often as lists in programming, but are used when immutability is necessary. If in your program you are passing around an object and need to make sure it does not get changed, then a tuple becomes your solution. It provides a convenient source of data integrity.\n\nSets\nSets are an unordered collection of unique elements. We can construct them by using the set() function. Let's go ahead and make a set to see how it works\n\nIn [1]:\nx = set()\nIn [2]:\n# We add to sets with the add() method\nx.add(1)\nIn [3]:\n#Show\nx\nOut[3]:\n{1}\nNote the curly brackets. This does not indicate a dictionary! Although you can draw analogies as a set being a dictionary with only keys.\n\nWe know that a set has only unique entries. So what happens when we try to add something that is already in a set?\n\nIn [4]:\n# Add a different element\nx.add(2)\nIn [5]:\n#Show\nx\nOut[5]:\n{1, 2}\n\nIn [6]:\n# Try to add the same element\nx.add(1)\nIn [7]:\n#Show\nx\nOut[7]:\n{1, 2}\n\nNotice how it won't place another 1 there. That's because a set is only concerned with unique elements! We can cast a list with multiple repeat elements to a set to get the unique elements. For example:\n\nIn [8]:\n# Create a list with repeats\nlist1 = [1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,1,1]\nIn [9]:\n# Cast as set to get unique values\nset(list1)\nOut[9]:\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nIt is very easy to get an error on this step:\n\nThis function is specific to jupyter notebooks! Alternatively, quickly create a simple .txt file with sublime text editor.\nIn [1]:\n%%writefile test.txt\nHello, this is a quick test file.\nOverwriting test.txt\n\nIn [1]:\nmyfile = open('whoops.txt')\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFileNotFoundError                         Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-1-dafe28ee473f> in <module>()\n----> 1 myfile = open('whoops.txt')\n\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'whoops.txt'\n        \n\n        \n        \nIn [3]:\n# We can now read the file\nmy_file.read()\nOut[3]:\n'Hello, this is a quick test file.'\nIn [4]:\n# But what happens if we try to read it again?\nmy_file.read()\nOut[4]:\n''\nThis happens because you can imagine the reading \"cursor\" is at the end of the file after having read it. So there is nothing left to read. We can reset the \"cursor\" like this:\n\nIn [5]:\n# Seek to the start of file (index 0)\nmy_file.seek(0)\nOut[5]:\n0\nIn [6]:\n# Now read again\nmy_file.read()\nOut[6]:\n'Hello, this is a quick test file.'\nYou can read a file line by line using the readlines method. Use caution with large files, since everything will be held in memory. We will learn how to iterate over large files later in the course.\n\nIn [7]:\n# Readlines returns a list of the lines in the file\nmy_file.seek(0)\nmy_file.readlines()\nOut[7]:\n['Hello, this is a quick test file.']\n\n\nWhen you have finished using a file, it is always good practice to close it.\n\nIn [8]:\nmy_file.close()\n\nWriting to a File\nBy default, the open() function will only allow us to read the file. We need to pass the argument 'w' to write over the file. For example:\n\nIn [9]:\n# Add a second argument to the function, 'w' which stands for write.\n# Passing 'w+' lets us read and write to the file\n\nmy_file = open('test.txt','w+')\nOpening a file with 'w' or 'w+' truncates the original, meaning that anything that was in the original file is deleted!\n\nIn [10]:\n# Write to the file\nmy_file.write('This is a new line')\nOut[10]:\n18\nIn [11]:\n# Read the file\nmy_file.seek(0)\nmy_file.read()\nOut[11]:\n'This is a new line'\nIn [12]:\nmy_file.close()  # always do this when you're done with a file\n\n\n\nAppending to a File\nPassing the argument 'a' opens the file and puts the pointer at the end, so anything written is appended. Like 'w+', 'a+' lets us read and write to a file. If the file does not exist, one will be created.\n\nIn [13]:\nmy_file = open('test.txt','a+')\nmy_file.write('\\nThis is text being appended to test.txt')\nmy_file.write('\\nAnd another line here.')\nOut[13]:\n23\nIn [14]:\nmy_file.seek(0)\nprint(my_file.read())\nThis is a new line\nThis is text being appended to test.txt\nAnd another line here.\nIn [15]:\nmy_file.close()\n\nIterating through a File\nLets get a quick preview of a for loop by iterating over a text file. First let's make a new text file with some IPython Magic:\n\nIn [17]:\n%%writefile test.txt\nFirst Line\nSecond Line\nOverwriting test.txt\nNow we can use a little bit of flow to tell the program to for through every line of the file and do something:\n\nIn [18]:\nfor line in open('test.txt'):\n    print(line)\nFirst Line\n\nSecond Line\n\nReassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead:\n\nIn [13]:\nlist3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]\nIn [14]:\nlist3[2][2] = 'goodbye'\nIn [15]:\nlist3\nOut[15]:\n[1, 2, [3, 4, 'goodbye']]\n\nSort the list below:\n\nIn [16]:\nlist4 = [5,3,4,6,1]\nIn [17]:\n# Method 1:\nsorted(list4)\nOut[17]:\n[1, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nIn [18]:\n# Method 2:\nlist4.sort()\nlist4\nOut[18]:\n[1, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nIn [32]:\n# Answer before running cell\n4**0.5 != 2\nOut[32]:\nFalse\n\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

{"cells":[{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Object Oriented Programming\nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) tends to be one of the major obstacles for beginners when they are first starting to learn Python.\n\nThere are many, many tutorials and lessons covering OOP so feel free to Google search other lessons, and I have also put some links to other useful tutorials online at the bottom of this Notebook.\n\nFor this lesson we will construct our knowledge of OOP in Python by building on the following topics:\n\nObjects\nUsing the class keyword\nCreating class attributes\nCreating methods in a class\nLearning about Inheritance\nLearning about Polymorphism\nLearning about Special Methods for classes\n\n\nObjects\nIn Python, everything is an object. Remember from previous lectures we can use type() to check the type of object something is:\n\nIn [3]:\nprint(type(1))\nprint(type([]))\nprint(type(()))\nprint(type({}))\n<class 'int'>\n<class 'list'>\n<class 'tuple'>\n<class 'dict'>\n\nclass\nUser defined objects are created using the class keyword. The class is a blueprint that defines the nature of a future object. From classes we can construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. For example, above we created the object lst which was an instance of a list object.\n\nLet see how we can use class:\n\nIn [4]:\n# Create a new object type called Sample\nclass Sample:\n    pass\n\n# Instance of Sample\nx = Sample()\n\nprint(type(x))\n<class '__main__.Sample'>\nBy convention we give classes a name that starts with a capital letter. Note how x is now the reference to our new instance of a Sample class. In other words, we instantiate the Sample class.\n\nInside of the class we currently just have pass. But we can define class attributes and methods.\n\nAn attribute is a characteristic of an object. A method is an operation we can perform with the object.\n\nFor example, we can create a class called Dog. An attribute of a dog may be its breed or its name, while a method of a dog may be defined by a .bark() method which returns a sound.\n\n\n\nThis method is used to initialize the attributes of an object. For example:\n\nIn [5]:\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self,breed):\n        self.breed = breed\n        \nsam = Dog(breed='Lab')\nfrank = Dog(breed='Huskie')\nLets break down what we have above.The special method\n\n__init__() \nis called automatically right after the object has been created:\n\ndef __init__(self, breed):\nEach attribute in a class definition begins with a reference to the instance object. It is by convention named self. The breed is the argument. The value is passed during the class instantiation.\n\n self.breed = breed\n    \n    \nNow we have created two instances of the Dog class. With two breed types, we can then access these attributes like this:\n\nIn [6]:\nsam.breed\nOut[6]:\n'Lab'\nIn [7]:\nfrank.breed\nOut[7]:\n'Huskie'\n\n\nIn Python there are also class object attributes. These Class Object Attributes are the same for any instance of the class. For example, we could create the attribute species for the Dog class. Dogs, regardless of their breed, name, or other attributes, will always be mammals. We apply this logic in the following manner:\n\nIn [8]:\nclass Dog:\n    \n    # Class Object Attribute\n    species = 'mammal'\n    \n    def __init__(self,breed,name):\n        self.breed = breed\n        self.name = name\nIn [9]:\nsam = Dog('Lab','Sam')\nIn [10]:\nsam.name\nOut[10]:\n'Sam'\nNote that the Class Object Attribute is defined outside of any methods in the class. Also by convention, we place them first before the init.\n\nIn [11]:\nsam.species\nOut[11]:\n'mammal'\n\n\nMethods\nMethods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to perform operations with the attributes of our objects. Methods are a key concept of the OOP paradigm. They are essential to dividing responsibilities in programming, especially in large applications.\n\nYou can basically think of methods as functions acting on an Object that take the Object itself into account through its self argument.\n\nLet's go through an example of creating a Circle class:\n\nIn [12]:\nclass Circle:\n    pi = 3.14\n\n    # Circle gets instantiated with a radius (default is 1)\n    def __init__(self, radius=1):\n        self.radius = radius \n        self.area = radius * radius * Circle.pi\n\n    # Method for resetting Radius\n    def setRadius(self, new_radius):\n        self.radius = new_radius\n        self.area = new_radius * new_radius * self.pi\n\n    # Method for getting Circumference\n    def getCircumference(self):\n        return self.radius * self.pi * 2\n\n\nc = Circle()\n\nprint('Radius is: ',c.radius)\nprint('Area is: ',c.area)\nprint('Circumference is: ',c.getCircumference())\nRadius is:  1\nArea is:  3.14\nCircumference is:  6.28\nIn the __init__ method above, in order to calculate the area attribute, we had to call Circle.pi. This is because the object does not yet have its own .pi attribute, so we call the Class Object Attribute pi instead.\nIn the setRadius method, however, we'll be working with an existing Circle object that does have its own pi attribute. Here we can use either Circle.pi or self.pi.\n\nNow let's change the radius and see how that affects our Circle object:\n\nIn [13]:\nc.setRadius(2)\n\nprint('Radius is: ',c.radius)\nprint('Area is: ',c.area)\nprint('Circumference is: ',c.getCircumference())\nRadius is:  2\nArea is:  12.56\nCircumference is:  12.56\n\n    \nInheritance\nInheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. The newly formed classes are called derived classes, the classes that we derive from are called base classes. Important benefits of inheritance are code reuse and reduction of complexity of a program. The derived classes (descendants) override or extend the functionality of base classes (ancestors).\n\nLet's see an example by incorporating our previous work on the Dog class:\n\nIn [14]:\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self):\n        print(\"Animal created\")\n\n    def whoAmI(self):\n        print(\"Animal\")\n\n    def eat(self):\n        print(\"Eating\")\n\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def __init__(self):\n        Animal.__init__(self)\n        print(\"Dog created\")\n\n    def whoAmI(self):\n        print(\"Dog\")\n\n    def bark(self):\n        print(\"Woof!\")\nIn [15]:\nd = Dog()\nAnimal created\nDog created\nIn [16]:\nd.whoAmI()\nDog\nIn [17]:\nd.eat()\nEating\nIn [18]:\nd.bark()\nWoof!\n\n\nIn this example, we have two classes: Animal and Dog. The Animal is the base class, the Dog is the derived class.\n\nThe derived class inherits the functionality of the base class.\n\nIt is shown by the eat() method.\nThe derived class modifies existing behavior of the base class.\n\nshown by the whoAmI() method.\nFinally, the derived class extends the functionality of the base class, by defining a new bark() method.\n\n\nPolymorphism\nWe've learned that while functions can take in different arguments, methods belong to the objects they act on. In Python, polymorphism refers to the way in which different object classes can share the same method name, and those methods can be called from the same place even though a variety of different objects might be passed in. The best way to explain this is by example:\n\nIn [19]:\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def speak(self):\n        return self.name+' says Woof!'\n    \nclass Cat:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def speak(self):\n        return self.name+' says Meow!' \n    \nniko = Dog('Niko')\nfelix = Cat('Felix')\n\nprint(niko.speak())\nprint(felix.speak())\nNiko says Woof!\nFelix says Meow!\n\n\nA more common practice is to use abstract classes and inheritance. An abstract class is one that never expects to be instantiated. For example, we will never have an Animal object, only Dog and Cat objects, although Dogs and Cats are derived from Animals:\n\nIn [22]:\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, name):    # Constructor of the class\n        self.name = name\n\n    def speak(self):              # Abstract method, defined by convention only\n        raise NotImplementedError(\"Subclass must implement abstract method\")\n\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    \n    def speak(self):\n        return self.name+' says Woof!'\n    \nclass Cat(Animal):\n\n    def speak(self):\n        return self.name+' says Meow!'\n    \nfido = Dog('Fido')\nisis = Cat('Isis')\n\nprint(fido.speak())\nprint(isis.speak())\nFido says Woof!\nIsis says Meow!\n\n\n\n\nReal life examples of polymorphism include:\n\nopening different file types - different tools are needed to display Word, pdf and Excel files\nadding different objects - the + operator performs arithmetic and concatenation\n\n\nHomework Assignment\nProblem 1\nFill in the Line class methods to accept coordinates as a pair of tuples and return the slope and distance of the line.\n\nIn [1]:\nclass Line(object):\n    \n    def __init__(self,coor1,coor2):\n        self.coor1 = coor1\n        self.coor2 = coor2\n    \n    def distance(self):\n        x1,y1 = self.coor1\n        x2,y2 = self.coor2\n        return ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5\n    \n    def slope(self):\n        x1,y1 = self.coor1\n        x2,y2 = self.coor2\n        return (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)\nIn [2]:\ncoordinate1 = (3,2)\ncoordinate2 = (8,10)\n\nli = Line(coordinate1,coordinate2)\nIn [3]:\nli.distance()\nOut[3]:\n9.433981132056603\nIn [4]:\nli.slope()\nOut[4]:\n1.6\n\n\n\nObject Oriented Programming Challenge - Solution\nFor this challenge, create a bank account class that has two attributes:\n\nowner\nbalance\nand two methods:\n\ndeposit\nwithdraw\nAs an added requirement, withdrawals may not exceed the available balance.\n\nInstantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account can't be overdrawn.\n\nIn [1]:\nclass Account:\n    def __init__(self,owner,balance=0):\n        self.owner = owner\n        self.balance = balance\n        \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f'Account owner:   {self.owner}\\nAccount balance: ${self.balance}'\n        \n    def deposit(self,dep_amt):\n        self.balance += dep_amt\n        print('Deposit Accepted')\n        \n    def withdraw(self,wd_amt):\n        if self.balance >= wd_amt:\n            self.balance -= wd_amt\n            print('Withdrawal Accepted')\n        else:\n            print('Funds Unavailable!')\nIn [2]:\n# 1.

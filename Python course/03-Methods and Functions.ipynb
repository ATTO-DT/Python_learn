Later on we will learn we can actually pass in functions into other functions! But for now, simply remember to call functions with ().\n\nIn [7]:\nsay_hello\nOut[7]:\n<function __main__.say_hello>\n\nAccepting parameters (arguments)\nLet's write a function that greets people with their name.\n\nIn [1]:\ndef greeting(name):\n    print(f'Hello {name}')\nIn [2]:\ngreeting('Jose')\nHello Jose\n\n\nExample: Addition function\nIn [6]:\ndef add_num(num1,num2):\n    return num1+num2\nIn [7]:\nadd_num(4,5)\nOut[7]:\n9\nIn [8]:\n# Can also save as variable due to return\nresult = add_num(4,5)\nIn [9]:\nprint(result)\n9\n\nVery Common Question: \"What is the difference between return and print?\"\nThe return keyword allows you to actually save the result of the output of a function as a variable.

That is to say you can quickly call the same function to every item in an iterable, such as a list. For example:\n\nIn [1]:\ndef square(num):\n    return num**2\nIn [2]:\nmy_nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nIn [5]:\nmap(square,my_nums)\nOut[5]:\n<map at 0x205baec21d0>\nIn [7]:\n# To get the results, either iterate through map() \n# or just cast to a list\nlist(map(square,my_nums))\nOut[7]:\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n\n\nfilter function\nThe filter function returns an iterator yielding those items of iterable for which function(item) is true. Meaning you need to filter by a function that returns either True or False. Then passing that into filter (along with your iterable) and you will get back only the results that would return True when passed to the function.\n\nIn [12]:\ndef check_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\nIn [13]:\nnums = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\nIn [15]:\nfilter(check_even,nums)\nOut[15]:\n<filter at 0x205baed4710>\nIn [16]:\nlist(filter(check_even,nums))\nOut[16]:\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\n\nlambda expression\nOne of Pythons most useful (and for beginners, confusing) tools is the lambda expression. lambda expressions allow us to create \"anonymous\" functions. This basically means we can quickly make ad-hoc functions without needing to properly define a function using def.\n\nFunction objects returned by running lambda expressions work exactly the same as those created and assigned by defs. There is key difference that makes lambda useful in specialized roles:\n\nlambda's body is a single expression, not a block of statements.\n\nThe lambda's body is similar to what we would put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general that a def. We can only squeeze design, to limit program nesting. lambda is designed for coding simple functions, and def handles the larger tasks.\n\n\nWe could actually even write this all on one line.\n\nIn [21]:\ndef square(num): return num**2\nIn [22]:\nsquare(2)\nOut[22]:\n4\nThis is the form a function that a lambda expression intends to replicate. A lambda expression can then be written as:\n\nIn [23]:\nlambda num: num ** 2\nOut[23]:\n<function __main__.<lambda>>\nIn [25]:\n# You wouldn't usually assign a name to a lambda expression, this is just for demonstration!\nsquare = lambda num: num **2\nIn [26]:\nsquare(2)\nOut[26]:\n4\n\nSo why would use this? Many function calls need a function passed in, such as map and filter. Often you only need to use the function you are passing in once, so instead of formally defining it, you just use the lambda expression. Let's repeat some of the examples from above with a lambda expression\n\nIn [29]:\nlist(map(lambda num: num ** 2, my_nums))\nOut[29]:\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\nIn [30]:\nlist(filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 0,nums))\nOut[30]:\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\n\nEnclosing function locals\nThis occurs when we have a function inside a function (nested functions)\n\nIn [5]:\nname = 'This is a global name'\n\ndef greet():\n    # Enclosing function\n    name = 'Sammy'\n    \n    def hello():\n        print('Hello '+name)\n    \n    hello()\n\ngreet()\nHello Sammy\nNote how Sammy was used, because the hello() function was enclosed inside of the greet function!\n\nGlobal\nLuckily in Jupyter a quick way to test for global variables is to see if another cell recognizes the variable!\n\nIn [6]:\nprint(name)\nThis is a global name\n\n\nThe global statement\nIf you want to assign a value to a name defined at the top level of the program (i.e. not inside any kind of scope such as functions or classes), then you have to tell Python that the name is not local, but it is global. We do this using the global statement. It is impossible to assign a value to a variable defined outside a function without the global statement.\n\nYou can use the values of such variables defined outside the function (assuming there is no variable with the same name within the function). However, this is not encouraged and should be avoided since it becomes unclear to the reader of the program as to where that variable’s definition is. Using the global statement makes it amply clear that the variable is defined in an outermost block.\n\nExample:\n\nIn [9]:\nx = 50\n\ndef func():\n    global x\n    print('This function is now using the global x!')\n    print('Because of global x is: ', x)\n    x = 2\n    print('Ran func(), changed global x to', x)\n\nprint('Before calling func(), x is: ', x)\nfunc()\nprint('Value of x (outside of func()) is: ', x)\nBefore calling func(), x is:  50\nThis function is now using the global x!\nBecause of global x is:  50\nRan func(), changed global x to 2\nValue of x (outside of func()) is:  2\n    \n    \n\n    *args\nWhen a function parameter starts with an asterisk, it allows for an arbitrary number of arguments, and the function takes them in as a tuple of values. Rewriting the above function:\n\nIn [3]:\ndef myfunc(*args):\n    return sum(args)*.05\n\nmyfunc(40,60,20)\nOut[3]:\n6.0\n\n\n**kwargs\nSimilarly, Python offers a way to handle arbitrary numbers of keyworded arguments. Instead of creating a tuple of values, **kwargs builds a dictionary of key/value pairs. For example:\n\nIn [5]:\ndef myfunc(**kwargs):\n    if 'fruit' in kwargs:\n        print(f\"My favorite fruit is {kwargs['fruit']}\")  # review String Formatting and f-strings if this syntax is unfamiliar\n    else:\n        print(\"I don't like fruit\")\n        \nmyfunc(fruit='pineapple')\nMy favorite fruit is pineapple\nIn [6]:\nmyfunc()\nI don't like fruit\n\n\n*args and **kwargs combined\nYou can pass *args and **kwargs into the same function, but *args have to appear before **kwargs\n\nIn [7]:\ndef myfunc(*args, **kwargs):\n    if 'fruit' and 'juice' in kwargs:\n        print(f\"I like {' and '.join(args)} and my favorite fruit is {kwargs['fruit']}\")\n        print(f\"May I have some {kwargs['juice']} juice?\")\n    else:\n        pass\n        \nmyfunc('eggs','spam',fruit='cherries',juice='orange')\nI like eggs and spam and my favorite fruit is cherries\nMay I have some orange juice?\n\n\nWrite a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (inclusive of high and low)\n\nIn [3]:\ndef ran_check(num,low,high):\n    #Check if num is between low and high (including low and high)\n    if num in range(low,high+1):\n        print('{} is in the range between {} and {}'.format(num,low,high))\n    else:\n        print('The number is outside the range.')\nIn [4]:\n# Check\nran_check(5,2,7)\n5 is in the range between 2 and 7\nIf you only wanted to return a boolean:\n\nIn [5]:\ndef ran_bool(num,low,high):\n    return num in range(low,high+1)\nIn [6]:\nran_bool(3,1,10)\nOut[6]:\nTrue\n\n\nWrite a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.\n\nSample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'\nExpected Output : \nNo. of Upper case characters : 4\nNo. of Lower case Characters : 33\n\nIf you feel ambitious, explore the Collections module to solve this problem!\n\nIn [7]:\ndef up_low(s):\n    d={\"upper\":0, \"lower\":0}\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isupper():\n            d[\"upper\"]+=1\n        elif c.islower():\n            d[\"lower\"]+=1\n        else:\n            pass\n    print(\"Original String : \", s)\n    print(\"No. of Upper case characters : \", d[\"upper\"])\n    print(\"No. of Lower case Characters : \", d[\"lower\"])\nIn [8]:\ns = 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'\nup_low(s)\nOriginal String :  Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?\nNo. of Upper case characters :  4\nNo. of Lower case Characters :  33\n    \n    \nWrite a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.\n\nSample List : [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]\nUnique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nIn [9]:\ndef unique_list(lst):\n    # Also possible to use list(set())\n    x = []\n    for a in lst:\n        if a not in x:\n            x.append(a)\n    return x\nIn [10]:\nunique_list([1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5])\nOut[10]:\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n\nWrite a Python function that checks whether a word or phrase is palindrome or not.\n\nNote: A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam,kayak,racecar, or a phrase \"nurses run\".

Also google search how to reverse a string in Python, there are some clever ways to do it with slicing notation.\n\nIn [13]:\ndef palindrome(s):\n    \n    s = s.replace(' ','') # This replaces all spaces ' ' with no space ''.
